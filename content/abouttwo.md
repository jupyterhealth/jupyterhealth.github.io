## **Why Choose JupyterHealth?**

- **Democratizing Health Data Management:** 
Historically, the integration of real-world data from patients into research and clinical care has been confined to the largest and most technologically sophisticated organizations. JupyterHealth is changing this landscape by championing open-source platforms and accessibility for all. Our initiatives are designed to level the playing field, allowing varied healthcare entities and research organizations to leverage comprehensive data for improved care and research outcomes.

- **Empowering Research and Care with Open Source Technology:** 
JupyterHealth embodies the ethos of Project Jupyter, bringing open-source software, shareable notebooks, and reproducible code into the healthcare domain. Our vendor-agnostic infrastructure ensures that various research groups and healthcare providers can adopt and adapt our platform without barriers, fostering unprecedented levels of collaboration across the healthcare ecosystem.

## **Understanding JupyterHealth**

- **Ensuring Interoperability and Data Sovereignty:**
In partnership with The Commons Project ([TCP](https://www.thecommonsproject.org/)), we focus on ensuring that our technical stack is interoperable with standard U.S. healthcare protocols. This collaboration not only expands our platform's capabilities but also allows various organizations to develop and implement advanced health technologies. JupyterHealth facilitates seamless data sharing among [The Common Health](https://www.commonhealth.org/) users and healthcare providers, enhancing data sovereignty and empowering users to fully control their data and infrastructure.

- **Streamlining Interactive Computing for Healthcare Professionals:**
In partnership with [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and International Interactive Computing Collaboration ([2i2c](https://2i2c.org/)), we advance interactive computing to support healthcare research and clinical practice. JupyterHub centralizes access to computational tools, removing the burden of software management and allowing healthcare professionals to concentrate on patient outcomes rather than IT overhead. Our platform is scalable and customizable, ensuring it meets the diverse needs of the healthcare community.
