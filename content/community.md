**Are you working on a healthcare project that could benefit from advanced data management and analytics?** JupyterHealth invites innovators, developers, researchers, clinicians, and technologists to engage with our platform. Together, we aim to improve healthcare through innovative technology and collaborative efforts.

JupyterHealth is being built on the foundation of mature [award-winning](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2024/03/21/white-house-office-of-science-technology-policy-announces-year-of-open-science-recognition-challenge-winners/) platforms, and standards, yet as an initiative, it is just beginning. Our future goal is to develop a community engagement similar to that of Project Jupyter ([learn about Jupyter’s community models](https://jupyter.org/community)) and establish a formal partnership structure.

## **Why Collaborate with Us?**
Engaging with JupyterHealth at this early stage offers a unique opportunity to shape its development. Early partners are visionaries – individuals, developers, researchers, or organizations – who are ready to innovate, contribute to the codebase, and help define the future of open-source healthcare technology.

## **Open Collaboration Model**

JupyterHealth champions open-source principles and values, welcoming contributions without the need for formal partnership:  we embrace open-source principles, that do not require formal partnerships for participation.

- **Utilize JupyterHealth Independently:** Implement JupyterHealth’s tools and modules in your own research or healthcare projects. Our detailed documentation provides all the necessary guidelines to help you integrate our platform smoothly and efficiently, whether you’re connecting with existing systems or embarking on a new project. Please [contact us](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf66RoskvOgvgecltyvo5QMl6lRZLXk6sB4GJqu0I_xJG6ACg/viewform) and let us know about your needs and interests. 

**Realistic Expectations:** We are candid about being in the development phase, which allows for substantial customization and influence over future capabilities. Early collaborators are crucial, helping us refine our offerings to better meet the diverse needs of the healthcare sector.

**Potential use cases**
* **Digital Health Researchers --** e.g. Developing new biomarkers by integrating data from wearables and EHRs to enhance treatment strategies.
* **Public Health Researchers --** e.g. Assessing environmental impacts on health, such as studying air quality and respiratory diseases using public and health data.
* **Population Health Researchers --** e.g. Analyzing socio-economic and healthcare access data to improve chronic disease management in underserved areas.
* **Service and Platform Providers --** e.g. Building predictive algorithms derived from patient-generated data. Service providers could create tools that predict patient health events based on continuous monitoring data, potentially reducing hospital readmissions.
* **Data Holders and Educational Institutions --** e.g. Facilitating access to anonymized data for research and educational purposes, fostering a data-driven approach in medical education and research.
